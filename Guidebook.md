# Flex Living Reviews Dashboard - Guidebook

## Overview
This project is a reviews dashboard for **Flex Living**.  
It fetches property reviews from the Hostaway API (or mock data if the API fails) and displays them with filtering, sorting, and approval features.

The app is built with:
- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Vercel** for deployment

## Features
- **Dashboard view** with review count, average rating, and approval stats.
- **Filter options** for:
  - Minimum and maximum rating
  - Category
  - Channel
  - Date range
  - Sorting order
- **Public view** to display approved reviews per property.
- **API Fallback** - automatically loads mock data if API request fails.
- **Approval toggle** to control which reviews appear on the public page.
- **Accessibility** improvements with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
- **Responsive design** for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Run Locally

cd flex-living-reviews-dashboard

# 2) Install dependencies
npm install

# 3) Env vars (create .env.local)

## Tech Notes

- **Type safety:** shared types in `lib/types.ts`.
- **Normalization:** raw Hostaway or mock items shaped in `lib/normalize.ts`.
- **Approvals store:** ephemeral in-memory state in `lib/approvalsStore.ts`.
- **Fallbacks:** `lib/hostaway.ts` tries API then falls back to local mock.
- **UI:** components in `components/*` (FilterBar, FiltersClient, ReviewCard, TopNav, Footer, etc.).
- **Accessibility:** semantic HTML, labels, keyboard-friendly controls.
- **Styling:** `app/globals.css` with utility classes; consistent spacing/tokens.
